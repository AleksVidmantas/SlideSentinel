This is the folder for all files related to single unit development and testing 
of the Adafruit MMA8451 Accelerometer. To fit the needs of the project, some of 
the adafruit library has been edited. Add the Adafruit_MMA8451_SS library to your 
Arduino libraries folder and rename it "Adafruit_MMA8451". Edits made include register 
definitions and flexible writing for configuration.
